## Instructions

You need to guess the 4 digit code. When you make an attempt, the game will show your guess and also how your guess compares with the hidden code. 

**There will be a list showing the compared results:**

* If you guess the correct position of a digit it will be displayed as green ‚úÖ
* If you did not guess the correct position of a digit it will be displayed as red ‚ùå
* If a digit from your guess is included in the code, but it is not on the correct position it will be displayed as yellow üîÑ

**You have 10 attempts to guess the code.**


**Beware**, not everything is at it seems. There are some shared secrets, hidden secrets, and maybe a wrong turn or two. There is a finish line, and it's not where you think. 

Those who actually finish will be listed on the elusive hidden leaderboard and can claim the title of **Cipher Master**. 

# Good luck!
